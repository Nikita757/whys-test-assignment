## Whys Test Assignment

### Brief Description
The goal of this assignment was to create a SPA in React, that rendered a post and comments for it. Application had to have 4 compulsory components:
- `Application` aka `PostPage` - that wraps post, comments and simulates data fetch.
- `Post` - that renderes a post.
- `Comment` - that renderes a single comment.
- `CommentsButton` - that renderes a show more button.

I've added a few more to make application look a bit prettier:
- `CommentSection` - that containes all rendered comments
- `Header` - for possible navigation bar
- `NavBar` - in current iteration contains only sign in/sign up buttons
- `SideBar` - for that contains tag cloud
- `TagCloud` - for tag cloud itself

## How to run it
Since the project was initialized via create-react-app utility running the website is as easy as installing all dependencies and running `yarn run start` or `npm run start` in your terminal.
